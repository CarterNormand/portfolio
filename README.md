# portfolio

The proccess with building my portfolio was tough. I wouldn't say I am great with coding to be honest. I took something I knew how to do and worked at it to make it better. I had troubles embedding videos in my portfolio, which is a huge thing for me, as I am a videographer. And I didn't know much about linking to other pages, like the about and contact pages. I got more comfortable with putting classes on lots of different things for organization and styling my portfolio. And I got better at creating buttons to take people to other pages, whether it was my show, my demo reel, or social media pages. I think the page is a great portfolio for me and suits me as a videographer well.

All images are mine except for the Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn logo's.
